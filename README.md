## Overview

Welcome to Kanban Desk, a powerful task management full-stack web application built with cutting-edge technologies. This project leverages TypeScript, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, NextAuth.js, Prisma, tRPC, and Zod to provide a seamless and feature-rich experience for managing tasks using the Kanban methodology.

## Features

1. Create Boards
Easily set up multiple boards to represent different projects, teams, or categories. Boards serve as the top-level container for organizing your tasks, providing a flexible structure to match your workflow.

2. Define Columns
Within each board, define custom columns that represent the different stages of your workflow. Whether it's "To Do," "In Progress," or "Completed," columns provide a visual representation of your tasks' progress.

3. Add Tasks
Populate your columns with tasks that encapsulate the work to be done. Each task can be assigned a title, description, due date, and other relevant details to ensure clarity and context.

4. Manage Subtasks
Break down tasks into subtasks to further detail and organize the work. Subtasks enable you to create a hierarchical structure, making it easier to track progress on smaller components of a larger task.
